# Hi there 

I'm **Gatheesha නිපුල්ම**-a highschool student, game developer, graphics designer and the co founder of **gatarita** games inc- from sri lanka! 

I have been making games since I was 13, almost for about 6 years, and in that time, I released two commercial games, one game for google play store and made many game jam projects.

Over the years, 
<!-- Over these years, I have worked on both extremely large projects for huge organisations and tiny projects for small startups. This has given me a lot of experience over a large variety of project types. It also means I’ve worked with a lot of teams in various sizes—each with their own constraints and goals. These projects vary between design systems, creative campaign work and good ol’ websites.

I mostly specialise in CSS—whether that is writing a course for Google, co-authoring a book on CSS layout, or creating a methodology to help people write better CSS. A big chunk of our client work involves us applying this experience to help teams write better CSS—often by helping them create a design system.

You can catch up with me on Mastodon, Twitter, CodePen or Github. There’s some other links here, too.

- **5 duotone themes**, depending on your preferences (orange, red, blue, green, pink)
- [**Fira Code**](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) as default monospaced font. It's gorgeous!
- **really nice, custom duotone** syntax highlighting based on [**PrismJS**](https://prismjs.com)
- mobile friendly layout -->

So, there you have it... enjoy!
