<!-- Back when Sri Lankan economical crisis got to its peak me and my friend Inuka teamed up to make a video game representing the mental state of litrealy every fellow sri lankan. I worked on it mostly as the artist, drawing everything on paper and bringing them to life with photoshop and frame by frame hand drawn animations.And as for the game engine we went with godot because its freaking awesome ya know. As our very first commerical release both of were really proud and happy for what we were able to achieve in a really short period of time with very limited resources. -->
