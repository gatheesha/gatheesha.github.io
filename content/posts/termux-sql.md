This tutorial is mainly aimed for those who want to mess around MySQL query language and learn how to work with it, like solely for academic purposes.

If you‚Äôre looking for a tutorial about actually hosting a database with your android (i heard its possible) you‚Äôve come to the wrong place.

### Note for AL ICT students üòè
> All this may seem little complicated for you, ik cause I‚Äôve been there but I really recommend all of you to break the ice and actually give it a go. This whole tutorial would take you about 10 minutes and trust me its reallyyy simple. I would say termux is a nice place for you to take a peek in the amazing ‚Äòopen‚Äô world of linux and command line tools in general. If you encounter any errors while executing the steps I‚Äôve mentioned below, try to read the output (even though it looks f scary and complicated) there's a huge chance that you‚Äôll understand whats going on. I always use google to look for solutions and in most of the times I do manage to find a working fix and learn a bunch at the same time.

## Setting Up Termux

The playstore version of termux is pretty old so its not recommended to download it from google playstore. Alternatively you can download and install termux apk from github.

### Downloading And Installing Termux

Head over to [termux-github-repo](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/releases/tag/v0.118.0) and download the **arm64** version cause its gonna work on most mobile phones, but if it doesn‚Äôt install go with the **armeabi-v7a **version apk.

After downloading install the apk as you would normally do, through the file manager.

## Installing MySQL

Before installing MySQL we have to do some configurations inside termux in order for things to work properly.

### Setting Up Storage

In termux type

```bash
termux-setup-storage
```

and hit enter. A window saying requesting storage permission should appear, press "Allow". This allows termux to store files on your mobile, and for you to access files on your phone through termux.

### Updating packages to install MySQL

In your Termux application execute

```bash
    apt update
```
And then:

```bash
    apt upgrade
```

In both cases, if the app asks, **choose yes**, that is, **put the letter ‚Äúy‚Äù and tap enter**. This step is very important because it will update the libraries that are necessary to install mysql on your mobile device.

### Installing MySQL(MariaDB)

OK, once you have your system updated we will install the MariaDB package. To do this, execute:

```bash
    pkg install mariadb
```

If it asks you, accept everything by writing the letter y. It may take a while, it depends on your device, so be patient.

## Testing MySQL on Android with Termux.

### Starting the MySQL deamon

After that, what we have to do is start the MySQL daemon **(this should also be done if we restart the phone. do the optional step to make the daemon start automatically)**.
To do this, execute:

```bash
    mysqld_safe -u root &
```

What we do is run mysqld_safe with the root user; the ampersand ‚Äú&‚Äù is to run it in the background like starting xampp or wimp server on your windows¬†PC. Run it and press Enter. This is how it looks in my case:

{{<figure src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2880/1*RSu9kTy-DJ5tY87qbQpLug.png" position="center" alt="mysqld_safe -u root &-screenshot" caption="starting mysql daemon">}}

### Optional : Making the daemon start automatically when log-ining

*special thanks to damindu dhanajitha ‚ù§*

Run the following command once and every time you start termux, MySQL daemon will be started automatically.

```bash
    echo "mysqld_safe -u root &" >> .profile
```

What we do here is using the linux default command ‚Äòecho‚Äô to add a new line in .profile file, everything in the .profile file will be executed automatically at the login.

### Testing MySQL (Mariadb) on Android with Termux

Now that we‚Äôve started the MySQL daemon its time to connect it from the client, execute:

```bash
    mysql -u root
```

Just as you would do on the command prompt of windows. This must have shown you something like this, (If not, make sure you started the demon.)

Congratulations now you‚Äôve got MySQL up and running on your smartphone. Its not a emulation of mysql like in most mobile apps, you‚Äôre hosting a server on your own, Pretty Awesome right?
