Video Games always have been the _ultimate form of art_ for me. I've always liked solving problems and the idea of trying to understand complex stuff. And I think that very interest got me into making games from a very young age- since i was 13.

Started my game development journey with construct 2, where you dont have to write a single line of code to make a game. So, I made few-actually quite a lot projects with it. Then over the years I got familier with wiriting code with c# and godot's gdscript while improving myself as an graphics designer.

I always focus on visual side of things, like no matter what- if I'm working on something, It has look good. So while making games, I've put hours and hours into making graphics elements like posters, character posters etc... This helped me a lot to hone my graphic designing skills, both illustrator and photoshop. I've worked as the lead graphics designer for ClubBrick commiunity and youtube channel based on the US. Also I have worked on many graphics desgining projects for both local and international clients.

Some random facts about me:

- I like movies, books and anime!
- Swifty!
- Right midfielder of the school soccer team
- For me 'happyness > money or pleasure'
